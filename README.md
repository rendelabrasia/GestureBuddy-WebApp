# Gesture Guide

## Overview
Gesture Buddy is a web application designed to translate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into written and spoken words in real-time. The project aims to enhance communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community by leveraging advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## Theory and Design
The project utilizes the SSD MobileNetV1 FPN architecture for efficient real-time object detection. Key components include:

**1.** **MobileNetV1 and Depthwise Separable Convolutions:** Reduces computational cost while maintaining performance.
**2.** **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN):** Enhances the model by integrating high-level semantic information across scales.
**3.** **SSD Framework:** Utilizes anchor boxes and loss functions for precise object detection.

## Materials and Components
Key software components used:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow Object Detection API
- CUDA and cuDNN
- Git
- IBM Cloud and Azure

## Performance Measurement Results
Key findings include:

**Detection Threshold:** Configured to display bounding boxes with a threshold probability of 0.7.

**Influence of Image Quality:** Performance affected by color, contrast, brightness, and gesture angle.

**Performance Tuning:** Optimal batch size of 32 identified for balancing detection accuracy and processing time.
